Regression analysis results show that the two predictors, source and destination bytes, are statistically significant and have a relationship with the response variable, outcome.  Source and destination bytes have p-values less than the significant level set at 0.05.  These two variables have an impact on the type of outcome a network indication system would present.  Therefore, both null hypotheses are accepted.  There is enough evidence to suggest that the number of source and destination bytes do have an impact on the type of outcome for network indication.  The accuracy of the logistic regression classifier on the test set was: 0.68.  This high number represents the strength of the regression analyses as a classifier for an anomaly or normal indication.  The confusion matrix results also suggest 3,067 correct predictions and 1,442 incorrect predictions.
