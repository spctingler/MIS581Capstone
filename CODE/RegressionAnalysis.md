Regression models are used to determine if there is a relationship between two variables.  The focus of regression analysis is to see if source and destination bytes have an impact on the outcome of a network detection system.  Regression analyses uses p-values and coefficients to define if the variables are statistically significant and whether a relationship exists between the predictor and response variables.  If the p-value is greater than a given significant level, in this case 0.05, there is not enough evidence to conclude that a relationship exists.

A logistic regression model is well suited for the research question at hand.  Logistic regression models predict if the response variable, outcome, has a relationship with a predictor variable. The predictor variables are source and destination bytes.  The difference between a linear regression and logistic regression model is that logistic regression predicts a binary outcome.  The binary outcome for this research project is 1 or 0, normal or anomaly respectively.  Logistic regression model provides “a measure of how a predictor (coefficient size) is, but also its direction of association (positive or negative)” (Ranjan-Rout, 2020, para 2).  Logistic regression models also work best with response variables that are categorical in nature.  In this case, outcome is denoted by either a 0 or 1, anomaly or normal respectively.
